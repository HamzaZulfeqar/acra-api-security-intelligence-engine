# ACRA Project State

## Current state — 2026-09-23

**Current sprint:** Sprint 6 — Tenant Isolation, Advanced RBAC and Policy Intelligence.  
**Decision:** S6 SOFTWARE COMPLETE — authorized local/synthetic scope.  
**Working branch:** `s6-tenant-rbac`.  
**Immutable Sprint 5 base:** `89ceb1eec0aca7ebb2c5db60b4bfce43251d0f84`.  
**Sprint 5:** SOFTWARE COMPLETE and preserved separately.  
**Sprint 7:** NOT STARTED.
**Frozen S6 checkpoint:** `s6-final-software-2026-09-23` at `8d996a2b2b1bb47372490945aec197dd9e20ff36`.

### S6 final closure

GitHub Actions run `35891427324` completed successfully.

- final verification: PASS
- official Maven package: PASS
- retained S2 tests: 52 PASS
- retained S3 core: 47 PASS
- retained S3 adapter: 11 PASS
- retained S4 UI: 26 PASS
- S6 Authorization UI: 27 PASS
- source archive entry count: 737

- final source archive SHA-256: `a26a20758e4c2e6db98995d2b6ec64e4bb81d3b1b5e76b4cf54567994e8fb724`

Real Burp desktop runtime remains separate and unverified; it is not part of the S6 software-complete claim.

### Implemented S6 capabilities

- authorization scope taxonomy
- tenant membership and multi-role assignment
- role hierarchy with cycle-safe inheritance
- permission and role-permission models
- explicit ALLOW / DENY rules
- explicit default decision and evidence-backed precedence
- global, shared and delegated authorization
- effective role and permission resolution
- tenant relationship classification
- tenant-isolation and RBAC assessments
- explicit privileged-action role-escalation assessment

### Newly verified planner/execution evidence

GitHub Actions run `35882729813` completed successfully on exact Temurin JDK 21.0.12.1.
`Sprint6PlannerExecutionIntegrationTestSuite` passed 15 assertions and proved a generated CROSS_TENANT test can
flow through the existing S4 planner, queue, safety validation and executor into the secure localhost ACRA-Lab.
Generated test `S6-AUTO-TENANT-a915a78d9e3fd8c06e49c4e9` completed with expected DENY,
`EXPECTED_CHANGE`, and queue state `COMPLETED`.

### Newly measured S6 evidence

GitHub Actions run `35878508170` completed successfully on exact Temurin JDK 21.0.12.1.

`EXP-S6-TENANT-RBAC-001` executed ten labelled localhost cases.

- naive baseline: TP=2, TN=1, FP=7, FN=0, precision=0.222222, recall=1.000000, F1=0.363636
- ACRA S6: TP=2, TN=8, FP=0, FN=0, precision=1.000000, recall=1.000000, F1=1.000000

These are controlled-fixture measurements only. They do not establish real-world scanner accuracy.

The campaign also exposed and closed a SHARED-scope isolation defect before the successful run.

### S6 authorization UI verification

GitHub Actions run `35885676715` completed successfully at commit
`7458b37706bb5ebe24839f3bb7464ef88ed41f4b`.

- Sprint 6 core/live verification: PASS
- Maven extension test compilation: PASS
- retained `Sprint4UiTestSuite`: PASS, 26 checks
- `Sprint6AuthorizationUiTestSuite`: PASS, 22 assertions
- Authorization product area now renders policy, tenant map, role assignments, hierarchy, permissions,
  effective authorization matrix, conflict assessments and coverage without inventing missing policy state.

### S6 reporting/export verification

GitHub Actions run `35887862337` completed successfully at commit `b051f08612730a455375e75312ca70d6e5fc9f6f`.

- `Sprint6ReportingExportTestSuite`: PASS, 19 assertions
- canonical report JSON / digest / Markdown artifact generation: PASS
- Maven extension compilation: PASS
- retained `Sprint4UiTestSuite`: PASS, 26 checks
- `Sprint6AuthorizationUiTestSuite`: PASS, 27 assertions
- report UI and JSON export UI are backed by the same S6 authorization product workspace
- report boundary preserves FindingCandidate as review-only and records confirmedFindingCount=0

### S6 performance/security closure verified

GitHub Actions run `35890873379` completed successfully at commit `76389e13b996a02c9f7011b262364b5b03a9231d`.

- `Sprint6PerformanceObservationTestSuite`: PASS, 12 assertions
- `Sprint6SecurityHardeningTestSuite`: PASS, 13 assertions
- 100 / 1,000 / 10,000 policy-resolution workloads completed
- policy-aware recommendation and report-generation workloads completed
- missing / ambiguous / spoofed authenticated-context references rejected
- path / non-authentication header / resource drift rejected
- unchanged authentication material rejected
- raw viewer/admin credentials excluded from serialized test state
- conflicting policy produces no executable S6 active seed

Observed CI timings are engineering observations only:
- 100: resolve 34 ms, planning 1 ms, report 9 ms, approx memory delta 2,948,768 bytes
- 1,000: resolve 57 ms, planning 2 ms, report 6 ms, approx memory delta 19,825,512 bytes
- 10,000: resolve 169 ms, planning 4 ms, report 29 ms, approx memory delta 10,003,728 bytes

Memory deltas are JVM-process observations affected by allocation/GC and are not monotonic or release thresholds.

### Legacy Sprint 2 / Sprint 3 CI closure

The retained Sprint 2 and Sprint 3 local-contract test/lab sources were restored from repository commit
`07a3f60bc2bd2218d0749e497b4f0b9dc57a9c2c`; they were not reconstructed from chat.

Current CI:
- Sprint 2 run `35890873262`: SUCCESS; Maven package PASS, Sprint2 tests=52, EXP-INTEGRATION-001 local-lab PASS
- Sprint 3 run `35890873276`: SUCCESS; Maven package PASS, Sprint2 tests=52, Sprint3 core=47, Sprint3 adapter=11, EXP-RECON-001 local-lab PASS
- official Maven test compilation excludes the legacy local-Montoya-stub suites because those suites target the preserved stub contract rather than the current official Montoya test interface
- real Burp desktop runtime remains a separate UNVERIFIED/BLOCKED gate

### Post-S6 deferred validation / later-sprint work

- fuller planner→controlled execution product integration
- UI for policy, role hierarchy, tenant map, effective permissions, conflicts and coverage
- report/export extension for S6 policy evidence
- larger performance workloads and memory profiling
- expanded negative-security and serialization audit
- requirements traceability / ADR closure
- full S1–S6 regression and Maven/package verification
- final Sprint 6 audit
- reproducible S6 ZIP + SHA-256 + manifest

Historical S2/S3 real Burp runtime validation remains separate and is not promoted by Sprint 6 evidence.
